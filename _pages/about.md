Hi, I'm Vamsi. I am a **Cloud-focused Senior Data Engineer** with deep expertise in Databricks/Spark, AWS, and Azure. I specialize in building scalable data platforms, handling complex migrations, and ensuring data governance and quality through automation and CI/CD.

Currently, I am expanding my horizons into **GenAI Engineering**, focusing on:
* Prompt Engineering
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) & Vector Databases
* LangChain & LangGraph for Agentic Workflows
* Production-grade LLM Systems

My goal is to bridge the gap between robust data engineering and cutting-edge generative AI applications.

## What I Do

*   **Data Platform Modernization**: Migrating legacy on-prem systems to cloud-native architectures (Databricks, Snowflake).
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating deployments using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.
*   **GenAI Development**: Building RAG pipelines and autonomous agents to solve real-world business problems.
